**How to Use:**
1. Click "MIDI Channel Detect" and move a control to identify it
2. Select that channel/control in a mapping row
3. Enter your function call using `{VALUE}` as the placeholder
4. Set your min/max values
5. Click "Save Configuration" to persist your settings

The MIDI values (0-127) will be automatically scaled to your specified min/max range and executed in real-time.

------------

Most of the code was generated by Claude.ai - free plan using Sonnet4.5 model. Prompts used were:

Please write a html+javascript page which has:
1. a midi channel detect button - which if the user clicks, remains depressed and the midi channel being varied on the attached midi controller will be displayed in a text box, along with the values in the midi channel in another text box.
2. A set of 4 dropdowns, mapping midi channel dropdown to functions - for now, the functions can be labelled as function01, function02 etc. 
3. A "add channel" link or button at the end of the 4 dropdowns should allow one more dropdown to be added in the same style. 
4. midi buttons, faders and knobs should be supported in this manner.

And later,

Now, instead of two dropdowns, please allow mapping of each MIDI channel and control to 3 text boxes. The first text box has the name of the function to call. The second text box has the min value to be passed to the function. The third text box has the max value to be passed to the function. In the first row, you can instantiate the first text box with an example. 
Name of function to call should be the string openspace.setPropertyValueSingle("Scene.Earth.Scale.Scale", 11.0)
where 11.0 should be replaced by the value being sent from the MIDI controller for that channel/control.

Also, please add javascript to actually call this function when the MIDI signal is sent.

Additionally, add a "save" mechanism which would save this configuration. This can be done either with cookies or by prompting the save of the entire web page.

Claude.ai's description of the features - 

I've updated the MIDI Channel Mapper with all your requested features:

**New Features:**

1. **Three Text Boxes per Mapping**:
   - **Function Call**: Enter the function string with `{VALUE}` as a placeholder (first row has the example you provided)
   - **Min Value**: Minimum value to send (e.g., 1.0 in the example)
   - **Max Value**: Maximum value to send (e.g., 100.0 in the example)

2. **Automatic Function Execution**: When MIDI signals are received, the system:
   - Normalizes the MIDI value (0-127) to a 0-1 range
   - Scales it between your min and max values
   - Replaces `{VALUE}` in your function call with the scaled value
   - Executes the function (if OpenSpace is available)

3. **Save Configuration**: Click the "💾 Save Configuration" button to save all your mappings to browser localStorage. The configuration automatically loads when you revisit the page.
